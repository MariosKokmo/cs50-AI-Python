The present repo is an attempt to document the solutions (as I developed them) for the
projects presented in the Harvard's CS50 course AI with python.
The course is 7 weeks long (as of November 2020) and each week a project needs to be worked.

Projects include the implementation of multiple classical (and not only) AI algorithms, ranging from Tree search, CSP, Propositional Logic,
Neural Nets, Machine Learning etc
